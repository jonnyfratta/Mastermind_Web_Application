    "fullRules": "Mastermind is a logic game where traditionally two players take turns in the roles of Codemaker and Codebreaker. The Codemaker chooses and hides the secret code, while the Codebreaker tries to guess it. In this digital version, the computer is the Codemaker, and you take on the role of the Codebreaker.\n\nThe goal of the game is to guess the Secret Code in as few attempts as possible, usually composed of four colored pegs. The Codebreaker proposes attempts with colored codes, and the Codemaker provides white and black Key Pegs for each attempt.\n\nThe rules for Key Pegs are as follows:\n  - Black Pegs indicate the colors of the Code in the correct position.\n  - White Pegs indicate colors present in the Code but in the wrong position.\n  - No Key Pegs for colors not present in the Secret Code.\n\nIt's important to note that White and Black Pegs only indicate the quantity of colored pegs present in the Secret Code, not their position. To avoid errors with repeated colors, the Codemaker places black pegs first and then white pegs, excluding colors already considered in the black pegs.",
